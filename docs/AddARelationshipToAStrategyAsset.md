# Add a Relationship to a Strategy Asset

When working in Strategy, you can only create asset relationships for
goals and initiatives, and only to other goals and initiatives.
Relationships to other assets (Rules, Policies, Terms, Systems, Data
Sets) must be created on those detail pages using the asset relationship
tabs. Refer to [Add a Relationship to a Non-Strategy
Asset](AddARelationshipToANonStrategyAsset.md) for more information.

Goals-to-goal and initiative-to-initiative relationships can only be
added by rolling the program-level asset up to the company-level asset.

To roll a program-level asset up to a company-level asset:

1.  Open the detail page for an asset.

2.  Click the **Roll Up to Company Level** drop-down link and select the
    company-level asset.

    >**NOTE:** The process is the same for rolling program-level goals
    and initiatives up to the company level.

To add a strategy relationship to a strategy asset:

1.  Open the detail page for a goal or initiative.

2.  Click the **Edit**
    (![](Resources/Images/pencil_icon_related_goals.png)) icon next to
    Related Initiatives/Goals.

3.  Click assets in the sidebar to add them to the selection.
    
    >**NOTE:** The program-level assets appear before the company-level
    assets. Click the arrow next to the program and company level names
    to hide/show the assets within that level.

    selection.

4.  Click **Done** to save the selection.
