# Add Initiatives

An Initiative defines the plan for how the Goals are going to be
achieved. Initiatives are time bound and their achievement is
measurable.

You can add a company or program level initiative. You can roll a
program level initiative up to a company level initiative. All
associated program level initiatives are displayed on company level
initiatives.

Before you begin this task, make sure you have selected the correct
context from the Company and Program strategy level drop-down on the
Home page.

To add initiatives:

1.  Select the **Strategy** to which you are adding the Initiative from
    the Strategy drop-down.

2.  Click the **Initiatives** tab.

3.  Do one of the following:
    
      - If this is the first Initiative added to the Strategy, click the
        **Click Here To Get Started** link.
    
      - If one or more initiatives have been added, click the **Pencil**
        (![](Resources/Images/edit_pencil1.png)) icon, and then click
        **New Initiative**.
