# Add a User to Entota™

You can add a user to Entota™ and assign permissions.

You can grant a combination of the following permissions to a user
depending on the access required.

  - **ADMIN** - Can add and edit user accounts and set user permissions
    to Platform components.
  - **APPROVER** - Can be set as an Owner for elements and can approve
    elements in order to publish them.
  - **AUTHOR** - Can create child elements - Processes, Scenarios,
    Roles, Tasks, and assets such as Terms, Rules, etc.
  - **USER** - Read-only access. This type of user can add comments,
    share a URL and view change history for an asset, but cannot sponsor
    an asset or otherwise edit it.

>**NOTE:** If a user has User permission for a component, that component
does not display in the Quick Add list because the user cannot add the
asset. Additionally, guidance related to adding or editing assets does
not display for a user with User permission.

>**NOTE:** To access the Entota™, all users must have User permission for
all Entota™ components, and this permission cannot be removed. It is
granted by default to all users.

>**NOTE:** If multiple permissions are assigned to a user, the level with
the broadest permission is used. For example, if a user is assigned as
both a User and an Approver, Entota™ grants the user Approver access.

>**NOTE:** If a user does not have permission to add an asset, it
displays dimmed with a lock icon on the Quick Add menu.

Permission can be granted to these components:

  - **Data Catalog** — Controls access to Systems and Data Sets.
  - **Glossary** — Controls access to terms.
  - **Strategy** — Controls access to Visions, Missions, Goals and
    Initiatives.
  - **Platform** — Controls access to Entota™. Admin permission at the
    Platform level is required to add users to Entota™.
  - **Process Designer** — Controls access to the Process Designer.
  - **Policy** — Controls access to policies.

Users can change certain settings for their own accounts from their
profile. Refer to [Update My Profile](Update_My_Profile.md) for
more information.
