## Access the Enhanced Search and Assets

To access the search page on all assets, click the search icon on the
search bar that is at the top of every page in the Entota™.

To navigate to specific assets in the Entota™, either click a **Jump
To...** link in the right panel or:

1.  Click the globe icon next to the search bar.
2.  Select a filter from the drop-down list.
3.  Enter a word or phrase in search bar, or leave the search bar blank.
4.  Click the **Search** icon.
5.  Refine the search by clicking more filter check boxes. The search
    repopulates each time a category check box is checked or unchecked.
6.  To remove a filter, click the **X** next to the filter name under
    Filtered by:, or uncheck the filter check box.
7.  Click the **Sort by** arrow to switch the sort order to Relevance,
    A-Z or Z-A.

To search for a specific phrase:

1.  Enter the phrase into the search bar.

2.  Select an Asset Type filter from the drop-down, if desired.

3.  Click the **Search** icon.
    
    >**NOTE:** Enter the phrase into the search bar before clicking the
    Search icon and selecting additional filters on the search page.
    Entering a phrase in the search bar after you have selected filters
    will reset the search and remove the selected filters.

>**NOTE:** If you type a query into the search bar and there are no
results for certain filters, those filters are hidden. The filters only
hide for results based on an initial query and do not update as you
select additional filters.

If you navigate to an asset detail page from the filtered search page,
you can click the browser back button to return to the filtered search,
but only the results from the initial query display. Additional filters
selected after the initial query is run will clear once you navigate
away from the search results page.

## Categories

The Enhanced Search uses Categories with check boxes to filter search
results. The categories include filters that can help managers and
employees keep track of assets and who they are assigned to, their
endorsement status, and the sponsors responsible for each asset.

The number of filtered results returned depends on whether you select
filters from the same category or from multiple categories. A broader
range of information can display if you select multiple filters in one
category. In this case, all the results for each filter selected
display. For example, selecting two users from the Assigned To category
displays all results for each assigned user. Narrow the range of
information returned by selecting filters from multiple categories. For
example, if you select filters for Term, Endorse Status: Candidate, and
Assigned To: John Doe, the results only display Terms that are in the
Candidate status and assigned to John Doe.

Categories delivered with the Entota™ include:

  - **Asset Types** — If you run the initial query filtered with a
    specific asset type via the Jump To... links or the drop-down search
    filter, then additional asset types cannot be selected. If you begin
    with an unfiltered search, you can select multiple asset types and
    results for each asset type appear. Asset types include:
      - **Term** — Results displayed are filtered by Terms included in
        the business glossary.
      - **Policy** — Results displayed are filtered by Policy.
      - **System** — Results displayed are filtered by System.
      - **Rule** — Results displayed are filtered by Rule.
      - **Initiative** — Results displayed are filtered by Company-level
        and Program-level Initiatives.
      - **Goal** — Results displayed are filtered by Company-level and
        Program-level Goals.
      - **Dataset** — Results displayed are filtered by Dataset.
      - **Mission** — Results displayed are filtered by the
        Company-level and Program-level Missions.
      - **Program** — Results displayed are filtered by Program.
      - **Vision** — Results displayed are filtered by the Company-level
        and Program-level Visions.
  - **Assigned To** — Users can assign non-Strategy assets to users that
    have permission to access those assets.
  - **Endorse Status** — Results displayed are filtered by the Endorse
    Status.
      - **Accepted** — Once an endorsement threshold is met, which is
        when the majority (greater than 51%) of sponsors have endorsed
        the asset, the asset is automatically moved to an Accepted
        status.
      - **Candidate** — Once a sponsor has been added to an asset, when
        assets details are defined, a sponsor can move the asset to the
        Review status. If one or more sponsors edits or contests an
        asset that has a status that is Review or Accepted, the asset
        moves back to Candidate status.
      - **Review** — Once a sponsor has been added to an asset, when
        assets details are defined, a sponsor can move the asset to the
        Review status.
  - **Sponsors** — Results displayed are filtered by the name of the
    Sponsors.
