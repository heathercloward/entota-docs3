### Announcing Entota
BackOffice Associates is combining the Cloud and On-Premise Platforms into a new software solution called Entota by BackOffice Associates. In your cloud tenant, you will immediately see the new logo and the name Entota replacing all references to IGC and Information Governance Cloud. The existing features and functionality of your tenant will not be affected by this change. Throughout 2019 and beyond we will continue to introduce new features and improved functionality to Entota that will take advantage of the scale and technologies of the cloud, leverage Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, and advanced analytics, allowing us to bring new innovative solutions to the challenges of data migration, quality, governance, and management.
