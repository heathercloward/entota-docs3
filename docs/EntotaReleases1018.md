### Enhancement

A new Migration dashboard has been added. This dashboard provides visibility into progress and status associated with enterprise Data Migration efforts by giving you access to the most important migration project metrics.

Using this dashboard you can:

* Understand the current status of migration waves.
* Identify any waves that are running behind schedule.
* Ascertain go-live readiness for a wave.
Whether you are responsible for one or multiple waves, across a single instance or multiple instances in the DSP®, you can view progress against milestones to assess risk and determine a need for resource adjustment and communicate effectively to all project stakeholders.

Refer to Migration Dashboard in the online help for more information.
