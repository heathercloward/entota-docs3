# Archiving

The archiving enforcement opportunity documents enforcement as part of a
data archival or a retention process. The enforcement methods available
for archiving are:

  - **Custom**—Used to document a connection to an enforcement
    application other than the DSP®. Add information regarding the
    enforcement technology and the appropriate contacts.
  - **Manual / Documentation**—Used to document the enforcement of a
    rule with a manual process that does not necessarily rely on
    additional technology. Add information regarding who enforces the
    rule and how it is done.
