# Search Process Designer

You can search within a Category in the Process Designer component.
Operators (for example, AND, OR, NOT or AND NOT) and wildcard characters
(for example, “\*”or “?”) are not allowed in the search.

You can search by partial words. For example, a search for “Sol” would
return Sold and Solid.

    **Search** icon.
    
    >**NOTE:** You can click an element type to filter on one or more
    elements to search only within that element type. Click the element
    type again to remove the filter.
