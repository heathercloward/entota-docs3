# Set Up Policies

You can add policy to your strategy. Polices are a statement of a
standard that guides business decisions. You can define the policy and
provide the purpose of the policy, in other words the business reason
this policy has been implemented.

Policies are enforced by [Rules](Set_Up_Rules.md).

As you are setting up a policy, you can click the Guidance
(![](Resources/Images/Guidance_Icon.png)) icon to open the Guidance
panel to view assistance. Refer to [Guidance](Guidance.md) for more
information.

>**NOTE:** If a user does not have permission to add an asset, it
displays dimmed with a lock icon on the Quick Add menu.

2.  Select **Policy** from the drop-down.

3.  Enter the policy name in **Policy**.

4.  Select a **Policy Type**.
    
    >**NOTE:** A guidance description of the policy selected appears in a
    tool tip.

5.  Enter a **Definition** of the policy.

6.  Enter the **Purpose** of the policy.

7.  Click the **Assigned To** drop-down and select a person from the
    list.
    
    >**NOTE:** When you assign a person to an asset, the assignee
    receives a notification by email, depending on their user settings.

8.  Click **Save**.

On the policy’s detail page, you can do the following:

  - Assign the criticality of the policy as High, Medium, or Low.

  - Add effective dates by entering a Start Date and End Date.

  - If the policy is in Review or Accepted status, and you are not a
    sponsor of the policy, you can be an additional endorser of the
    policy by clicking the Add Your Endorsement icon. Your name is added
    to the Additional Endorsers list.

    a policy](Contest_an_Asset_Non-sponsors.md) for more
    information. Refer to [Sponsor an Asset](Sponsor_an_Asset.md)
    for details about the asset endorsement process such as how it
    affects the asset’s status.
