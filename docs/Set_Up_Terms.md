You can define terms to improve business understanding and use of data.

(![](Resources/Images/Guidance_Icon.png)) icon to open the Guidance
panel to view assistance. Refer to [Guidance](Guidance.md) for more
information.

2.  Select **Term** from the drop-down.

3.  In the Quick Add modal, enter a **Term** name.

4.  Enter the **Definition**.

5.  Click the **Assigned To** drop-down and select a person from the
    list.
    
    >**NOTE:** This person can add sponsors to the asset to facilitate
    the endorsement process.
    
    >**NOTE:** When you assign a person to an asset, the assignee
    receives a notification by email, depending on their user settings.

6.  Do one of the following:
    
      - Click **Full Page Detail** to open the detail page for the term
        once you have entered the term and description in the Quick Add
        modal. Click **Save** to save changes made on the detail page.
    
      - Click **Quick Add**.
        
        >**NOTE:** To access the term after you click Quick Add, [search
        for the term](Enhanced_Search.md).

On the term’s detail page, you can do the following:

  - Mark the term as a Critical Data Element by clicking the toggle.
    
    >**NOTE:** When you mark a term as a Critical Data Element, you
    indicate that the asset has priority over other non-critical assets.
    This is for documentation purposes only.

  - Provide more context for a term by completing the Additional
    Information field. For example, an explanation about why a term is
    considered a Critical Data Element can be provided.

  - Create a term-to-term relationship. Refer to [Add a Term-to-Term
    Relationship](AddATermToTermRelationship.md) for more information.

  - Create a relationship to an asset. Refer to [Add a Relationship to a
    Non-Strategy Asset](AddARelationshipToANonStrategyAsset.md) and
    [Add a Relationship to a Strategy
    Asset](AddARelationshipToAStrategyAsset.md) for more information.

  - If the term is in Review or Accepted status, and you are not a
    sponsor of the term, you can be an additional endorser of the term
    by clicking the Add Your Endorsement icon. Your name is added to the
    Additional Endorsers list.

asset](Contest_an_Asset_Non-sponsors.md) for more information.
