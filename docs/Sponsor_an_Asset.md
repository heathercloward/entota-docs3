# Sponsor an Asset

As a sponsor of an asset, you can update the status of the asset and
provide endorsement of or contest an asset.

When the asset details are defined, sponsors are notified and a sponsor
moves the asset to Review status and all sponsors of the asset are
notified. If a sponsor contests an asset that is in Review status, the
asset is moved back to Candidate status and the color of the Status text
changes to reflect that it has been contested, and all sponsors and
assignees will receive notification by email, depending on their user
settings. If a sponsor edits an asset that is In Review or Accepted
status, the asset is moved back to Candidate status. Once an endorsement
threshold is met, which is when the majority (greater than 51%) of
sponsors have endorsed the asset, the asset is then moved to an Accepted
status.

The action taken by each sponsor is indicated in the Sponsors panel:

Asset statuses are:

  - **Candidate** – Asset has not been moved to Review. Details are
    still being defined. Or, the asset is contested by one or more
    Sponsors.
    
    >**NOTE:** This is denoted by orange text of the status indicator.
    The endorsement process must be started again by resending the asset
    for review.

  - **Review** – Asset is being reviewed by sponsors. All Sponsors are
    notified when the asset is in review.
    
    >**NOTE:** All Sponsors and Assignees are notified by email,
    depending on their user settings, when the asset is in review.

    notified when the asset is accepted.
    
    >**NOTE:** All Sponsors and Assignees are notified by email,
    depending on their user settings, when the asset is accepted.

    from Candidate to Review, by clicking the Send For Review button in

    >**NOTE:** All Sponsors are notified when an asset’s status is
    changed to Review.
    
    >**NOTE:** The status below the name of any sponsor who previously
    contested the asset is changed from orange to gray in the Sponsors
    panel.

2.  Next, you can do one of the following:
    
      - To endorse the asset, click **Endorse** in the endorsement
        notification.

      - To contest the asset, click **Contest** in the endorsement
        notification, enter a Comment, and then click **Done**.
        
        >**NOTE:** This changes the asset’s status back to Candidate and
        a sponsor must start the process again by resending the assets
        for review, by clicking Send for Review in the status panel.
    
      - Edit the asset’s details.
        
        >**NOTE:** You must provide a comment. Editing the asset changes
        the asset’s status back to Candidate and all sponsors are
        notified.

The status below your name in the Sponsors panel is updated to note the
actions you take.
