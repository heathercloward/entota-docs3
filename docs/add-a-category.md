# Add a Category

In the Process Designer, a Category allows you to organize your
Processes and their elements into logical groupings, such as line of
business, business unit, data domain, etc.

1.  Click **+** to add a Category.

2.  Enter a **Category Name**.
    
    >**NOTE:** The name must be unique.

3.  Select **Owner(s)**.
    
    >**NOTE:** Owners must have Approver access for the Process Designer
    component and the Category in use. For new Categories, only users
    with All Categories access can be selected. Once the Category is
    created, users can be granted specific permissions to the Category
    to be added as an Owner.

4.  Enter a **Description**.

5.  Provide a description for the **Category** so its purpose can be
    easily identified.

6.  Click **Save** to create a Category.
