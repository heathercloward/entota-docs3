>**NOTE:** For example, you can add “is related to” relationships between
the term Customer to terms such as Name, Phone Number, Address, and
Telephone Number. Alternatively, you can add an “is part of a(n)”
relationship between Customer and Address, as an Address is part of a
customer record. You can also establish a relationship where Customer
"has a(n)" Sales Order.

1.  Click the **Terms** tab.
