# Add Supporting Documentation to Assets

You can attach documentation that relates to an asset.

To add supporting documentation to an asset:

1.  [Search for and open the asset.](Enhanced_Search.md)

2.  Click the **Supporting Documentation** tab.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/supporting_doc.png)

3.  Add the title for the documentation in the **ADD TITLE** field.

4.  Paste the URL to the documentation in the **PASTE URL** field.
    
    >**NOTE:** Starting with DSP 7.0.2, users can easily copy DSP page
    URLs, filtered or with binding criteria, to use as documentation for
    an asset in Entota. These URLs are copied from any page in the DSP
    by using the Copy URL to Clipboard option in the DSP Settings menu.
    The URL takes them to the page where it was generated with the same
    drill through and the same filters applied, so users can target
    specific records. See [DSP Navigation and Menu
    Options](https://dsphelp.boaweb.com/702/general/DSP_Navigation.md)
    for more information.

5.  Click the plus sign icon.
