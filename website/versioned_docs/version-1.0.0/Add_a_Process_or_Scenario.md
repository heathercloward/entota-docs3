# Add a Process or Scenario

Process Designer is the application that enables you to visually build
and manage your processes. You can access the detail modal to add a
Process or Scenario element. Adding a Process or Scenario element is the
first step in creating an Information Governance flow.

1.  In the Process Designer, select a **Category** to begin.

2.  Click an **Add New** card to add a Process or Scenario.
    
    >**NOTE:** A Scenario defines the workflow used when data needs to be
    created, updated, or extended. A Process defines the workflow
    between multiple Scenarios (sub-processes).

3.  Enter a **Name**.
    
    >**NOTE:** Name must be unique.

4.  If adding a scenario, select a **Scenario Type**.
    
    The scenario type helps describe the purpose of the scenario.
    
      - **Create** - Creates new business objects, such as materials,
        customers, vendors, profit centers, GL accounts, etc.
      - **Change** - Updates the data for an existing business object.
      - **Organizational Extend** - Extends an existing business object
        to one or more Org Units, such as an existing material to a new
        plant.
      - **Business Extend** - Makes a new business object that is
        associated with an existing business object.

5.  Select **Owner(s)**.
    
    >**NOTE:** Owners must have Approver access to the governance
    elements in the Category. These permissions are set in
    Administration.

6.  Enter a **Description**.

7.  Click the **Documentation** tab.
    
    >**NOTE:** You can add supporting documentation links on the
    Documentation tab.

8.  Click **+** and enter a URL to the supporting documentation.
    
    >**NOTE:** You can enter a Friendly Name that describes the URL.
