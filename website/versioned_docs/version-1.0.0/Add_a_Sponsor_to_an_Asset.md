# Add a Sponsor to an Asset

You can add one or more sponsors to your asset. When you add a sponsor,
the sponsor receives a notification in their notification panel and
email, depending on their user settings.

To add or remove a sponsor:

1.  Click the **Sponsors** icon
    (![](Resources/Images/sponsors_icon.png)) on an asset’s detail page.

2.  Do one of the following:
    
      - In the Sponsors selection panel, scroll to and click a person’s
        name to select that person as a sponsor.
    
      - Start typing a name in the space provided, and then click a
        person’s name to select that person as a sponsor.
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
      - Click the **x** next to the person’s name to remove them from
        the selection list.
