# Data Catalog

The Data Catalog is the foundation for data-driven governance, allowing
members of an organization to identify where data is stored, who owns
it, and how it is used.

The Data Catalog consists of two assets, Systems and Data Sets.

Systems allow a user to capture information about where data is stored,
whether it is in a flat file, an ERP system, a database, a data
warehouse or other locations.

A System has fields, which are imported with a file upload process. The
imported fields are used to create Data Sets.
