# Deep Guidance™ Inferred Relationships

Entota™ can infer a relationship between assets using Deep Guidance™,
which examines the language used in describing an asset to determine a
relationship. For example, Deep Guidance™ analyzes the Definition of a
Term for language that has previously been used in a Rule to create an
inferred relationship between the two. The inferred relationship is
automatically associated on the detail page for both the Term and Rule.

The Discover icon in the Relate Assets pane on a detail page indicates
assets that are related using Deep Guidance™.

Terms can be added from the Deep Guidance Inferred Relationship section
to the user-chosen section directly on the Asset Detail page's Terms
tab. Refer to [Add a Term-to-Term
Relationship](AddATermToTermRelationship.md) for more information.

You can remove inferred relationships by editing the asset’s
relationships.

    (![](Resources/Images/pencil_icon_related_goals.png)) icon next to
    the relationship type.

2.  Click the **x** next to the asset to remove it from the selection.

3.  Click **Done**.

4.  Click **Save**.

>**NOTE:** Once removed, the relationship will not be suggested again.
