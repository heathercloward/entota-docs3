### Enhancements

Term relationships have been enhanced to allow selection of the context of the relationship so that users can properly model the business usage and increase the understanding of the data. Users can now select from the following types of term-to-term relationships:

* has a(n)
* Is part of a(n)
* is a(n)
* is like
* is a synonym of
* is related to a(n)
For example, you can create a contextual relationship in which a Customer has a Name, Phone Number, Address, and Telephone Number. And a relationship where an Address is part of a customer record.

If you have existing synonyms for previously added terms, the synonyms will be converted to the “is a synonym of” relationship type with this release.

Refer to Set Up Terms for more information.
