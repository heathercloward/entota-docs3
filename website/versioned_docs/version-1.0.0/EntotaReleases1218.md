### Enhancements
* Starting with DSP 7.0.2, users can now easily copy DSP page URLs, filtered or with binding criteria, to use as documentation for an asset in IGC. These URLs are copied from any page in the DSP by using the Copy URL to Clipboard option in the DSP Settings menu. The URL takes them to the page where it was generated with the same drill through and the same filters applied, so users can target specific records.See Add Supporting Documentation to Assets for more information.
* The topic IGC WebSocket Firewall Requirements has been added to the help.
