# Guidance

When you are viewing the details of an asset, you can click the Guidance
(![](Resources/Images/Guidance_Icon.png)) icon to see guidance for
adding details to increase the business value of an asset. For example,
if you have not assigned an asset or added a sponsor, the following
guidance is offered. As you add the suggested details to the asset, the
suggestion is removed from the Guidance panel.

In addition to guidance for increasing business value, the guidance
displays terms you can add to your Terms glossary based on the content
you have entered in certain fields.

Potential terms are highlighted yellow. Terms that are already in the
glossary are highlighted in pink.

>**NOTE:** When you click in a field to start editing it, the
highlighting is removed so that it does not get in the way of your
editing.

The content is analyzed and the suggested terms are displayed in the
Guidance panel.

If you want to add a suggested term to your glossary, click **+ Add**
next to the term. The Quick Add panel displays to allow you to add the
term.
