# Set Up a Data Set

Data Sets can be a subset of a single System or span Systems and tie the
generic business-focused documentation of terms, policies and rules to
where the data is stored. For example, a rule can score the Data Set for
data quality. A term can be related to Data Sets, which also ties the
term to their related Systems. A business process could create a Data
Set.

>**NOTE:** If a user does not have permission to add an asset, it
displays dimmed with a lock icon on the Quick Add menu.
