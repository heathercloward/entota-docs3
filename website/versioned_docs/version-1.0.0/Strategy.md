# Strategy

The Strategy component of Entota™ allows you to examine your business
strategy in depth, including the business vision and strategic goals,
KPIs, policies, and business processes.

Using the Strategy component of Entota™, you can capture the key
strategic context under which all Governance and Stewardship activities
operate. You can then tie the elements captured in the Strategy
component to assets throughout Entota™ to see how these assets relate to
the higher-level business strategy. By capturing and relating these
strategic assets, you can analyze how your business strategy is affected
by critical data.

The Entota™ Strategy component allows you to define your company
strategy and your data governance program strategy.

The company strategy is your enterprise-level business strategy that
contains the company’s vision, mission, goals and initiatives related to
your business objectives. The data governance program strategy has its
own vision, mission, goals and initiatives specific to the company’s
data governance efforts. Data governance goals and initiatives are
rolled up to the business level goals and initiatives. This allows you
to tie data governance goals and initiatives to your overall business
objectives.

You can switch between the company business strategy and the data
governance program strategy on the Entota™ Home page.

Depending on your user permission, you can click the Edit icon to edit the name of the
data governance program. The company name cannot be edited; it is
configured when Entota™ is set up.
