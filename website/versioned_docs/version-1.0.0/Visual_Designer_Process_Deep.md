# Visual Designer - Process Deep Dive

You can create a Process design flow in the Visual Designer as part of
creating an Information Governance flow. You can use shapes to create
the Process design flow and add Start, End and Decision Points. Before
you proceed with this task, you must first add a Process.

1.  In the Process Designer, click the Visual Designer icon
    (![https://d2qhvajt3imc89.cloudfront.net/customers/Backoffice/VisualDesigner.png](Resources/Images/Visual_Designer_Scenario_Deep.png)
.md) on one of your Process cards.

2.  Click and drag the **Scenario** shape to add a Scenario.

<!-- end list -->

4.  Add **Start** and **End Points**.

    >**NOTE:** Processes should have one Start Point and at least one End
    Point. If a Decision Point is used, which results in multiple
    branches in the design flow, each branch should have an End Point.

<!-- end list -->

5.  Add **Decision** **Points** (the triangle shape).

    >**NOTE:** You can use Decision Points to create branches in the
    design flow.
    
    >**NOTE:** You can navigate between Processes and Scenarios that you
    have recently viewed using the breadcrumbs bar below the workspace.
