# Welcome to Entota™ Help

Entota™ provides a holistic view from a single console across your data
landscape, with key features to help you easily design and set data
policies in your everyday governance work, without any programming.

Entota runs on Chrome and Internet Explorer 11. Safari is supported but
not certified.

The [What's New](https://whatsnew.igchelp.com/) page lists enhancements
and bug fixes.

## What’s in Help

This help system provides an overview of the key features of Entota™,
including:

**[Administration](Administration.md)** – Add and maintain user
accounts.

## Strategy

**[Search](Enhanced_Search.md)** – Use the search bar to find assets.

**[Vision, Mission, Goals and
Initiatives](Vision_Mission_Goals_and_Initiatives.md)** –
Define and document your strategy at a company or program level in a
single location, and ensure that each level of this hierarchy supports
the organization’s Vision. Share this strategy across all levels of the
organization.

**[Policies](Set_Up_Policies.md)** – Define, collaborate on, and
approve a set of policies, and create relationships among terms, rules
and other assets. Policies document initiatives or a direction the
organization is heading, whether internal or externally forced. Policies
can have Rules, although this is not required.

**[Rules](Set_Up_Rules.md)** – Define platform-independent rules,
in words not code. Ensure a policy is compliant by collecting and
organizing rules.

**[Terms](Set_Up_Terms.md)** – See the definition and details about
a term from relevant areas in the application where that term is used.

**[Sponsors](Sponsors.md) and
[Endorsements](Sponsor_an_Asset.md)** – Define who is responsible
for assets and work through an endorsement process to ensure
stakeholders agree.

**[Notifications](Notifications.md)** – Let users know that a task is
waiting on their input or that action has been taken on their assets.

**[**Data Catalog**](Data_Catalog.md)** – Publish and register
systems from all data sources on premises or in the cloud. These data
sets can be searched so that users may easily find what they are looking
for. Associate data sets to terms, policies, rules, processes, roles,
goals and initiatives.

## Process Designer

Use a collaborative business process modeling and design workspace for
the business processes, scenarios, roles and tasks that make up governed
data processes.

**[Visual Designer](Visual_Designer.md)** – Create an Information
Governance flow. The Visual Designer allows you to visually create and
manage your Processes and Scenarios. You can use shapes to create a
design flow and search for elements to reuse them in a design.
