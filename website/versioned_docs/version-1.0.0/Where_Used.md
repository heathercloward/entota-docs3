# Where Used

You use the Where Used view to see where a design element is used within
a category. For example, you can view all the scenarios in which a
particular role is used and all the tasks that have been added to that
role. With this information, you can better understand how changes to
the role affect other areas of the governance hierarchy.

To view information about where an element is used in a governance
hierarchy, in Process Designer, click the Where Used
(![](Resources/Images/WhereUsedIcon.png)) icon on the elementâ€™s card.

  - The Element Count indicates the number of places where the element
    is used.
    
    >**NOTE:** You can use the Zoom tools to zoom the flow.

    **Edit** icon to edit the elements details.
